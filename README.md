# Introduction
This project originated from a school assignment. When faced with the lack of project ideas, I intentionally chose to create one inspired by Cal Newport strategies rule 3 of total loop closer (MSP or multi-scale planning).
My main goal was to develop a tool that could be useful to others, in line with the school assignment.

Cal Newport's rule 3 of total loop closer strategy, as mentioned in a recent pocast [here](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=HyFaIHMEkg4&si=XNOG_g_xCMVgvyNr).

Personally, I think that this project could have the potential to grow to a fancy time management tool (but still the focus on multi-scale planning).

## Main functionalities
The main functionalities are simple: 
- Defining goals (day, week, month, quarter, year
-  Defining prio for each goal
-  Goals are grouped by roles(personal, student, employee)
